Instagram Bruteforcer with session saver
### Educational Purposes Only, I Don't Take Responsability For Any Other Use

# Usage
### This script use tor, install it before run. Instagram block requests but few nodes are valid. It will try the password bruteforcing the exit node. Trust me, it works :) . Obviously it may take several time even with a bunch of passwords, so let the computer running.
#### There's also a session saver, pressing CTRL + C will exit saving automatically the session. Don't need to worry about this.   Next time you'll run the script, it automatically backup the previous session with the same User && Wordlist

___The usage is very simple. The only parameters are the username and a wordlist___
```
chmod +x br.sh
```

```
sudo ./br.sh <username> <wordlist>
```

``` 
sudo ./br.sh myaccount wlist.txt 
```
