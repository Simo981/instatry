# Usage
### This script use tor, install it before run. Instagram block requests but a few node are valid. It will try the password bruteforcing the exit node. Trust me, it works :) . Obviously it may take several time even with a bunch of passwords, so let the computer running.

___The usage is very simple. The only parameters are the username and a wordlist___

` ` `
sudo ./br.sh <username> <wordlist>
` ` `

sudo ./br.sh myaccount wlist.txt
